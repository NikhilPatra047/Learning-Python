Python doesn't have the concept of access specifiers. However, there are certain patterns that can be used to help any developer understand if the variable is private, public, or protected.

# variable_name - public variable

# \_variable_name - protected variable

# \_\_variable_name - public variable

Python doesn't have the concept of virtual functions. All functions in python are "virtual" by default. This means the functions can be overriden and the function to be called is determined by the python interpreter during the runtime of the program.
