# Welcome Everyone!

I am Nikhil, a frontend developer at a startup organisation with 1.5 years of work experience. I work with Next.js, React.js, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Git, Redux, Jest, Tailwind, Prisma ORM, SQL, and Postgresql. As an ardent learner, I tend to use my leisure time outside of my job to keep learning new things to keep myself updated with the latest job trends, and just for the sake of having fun because that's the primary reason why I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Science. To tinker with technology, and end up discovering something new.

That being said, Learning Python is my new addition to the learning adventure and the first repository that I chose to upload in GitHub treating GitHub not just a Version Control System to keep track of my projects but also as a record of things that I keep learning.

# What resources did I use to learn the basics of Python?

- Harvard's CS50P - Introduction to Programming with Python by David J. Malan
- Frontend Masters - Intermediate Python by Nina Zakharenko
- The Official Python Documentation

# What did I learn during this time?

## Objective: To learn Python for the purpose of Web Development and solving algorithmic problems.

It has been 4 years (started 2021 when I was in college) since I started programming in Javascript, and ever since then I have been using to type all sorts of programs - from practicing algorithmic questions to creating web applications with React, and mobile applications with React Native. At my workplace, I got introduced to its superset Typescript (even though I was aware of it before my job). During my college I have learned other programming languages like C, and C++ but they aren't the programming languages that I use on a daily basis either in my work or in my personal projects. So, I decided to learn Python because first - it's a high-level programming language just like Javascript, second - I want to learn it for backend development purposes.

During this time I learned about the different data types in Python, conditional statements, loops, match statements, certain **Pythonic** way of writing code in Python, Object Oriented Programming in Python (class, instances, decorators, static methods, class methods, abstract classes, inheritance, method overloading, method overriding, encapsulation, getters and setters methods, the convention used in Python for specifying private, protected, and public variables, etc.), Regular Expressions, Writing Unit Tests in Python using Pytest, use of libraries, Error and Exceptions.

# What do I intend to do now?

My focus right now is to hone in on the skills that I learned during this time by utilising what I have learned to practice algorithmic problems, and use the language to build projects. The primary motive behind doing this is truly allow my brain to cement the knowledge that I have gained and gain a certain level of grasp over the programming language.

That said, this repository can also be treated as a reference material for anyone that wishes to learn Python. There are examples specified. However, in order to move in depth to learn about the syntaxes, methods, etc. you need to refer to video materials, ChatGPT, and forums to clear your doubts or you could just email me at `patra.nikhil04@gmail.com` and I could try answering your doubts!
